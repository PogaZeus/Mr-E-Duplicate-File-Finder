Self taught, terrible at coding but I have been dabbling with computers and code for a long time however I don't have much to show for it, so I've started developing some apps with the help of AI. 

So yes, this is a mixture of me and AI helping me

What's in this version 1.0
• Select a folder or a drive (large drives may take longer to scan or compute the files to count, but it should be working).
• Scan/progress bar and results - Right click to open the file path or delete the unwanted files.

It shows' Exact file matches (same file name and size, date created) and Close matches (same file name, different size, or date created).

I've not tried to limit the options a bit, such as 'delete all' as deleting the wrong files could be dangerous, so for now this is simple.

Whats to potentially come?
 - I'd like to add filters, search by file type groups (images, music, video etc) or possibly exclude file types
 - Possibly combine 'Folders' and Results together

Can't guarantee I will update this much, or often, or atall! though so if someone wants to commit to it then I'll be interested to see what someone would add.
